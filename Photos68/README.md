## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## HOW TO START
You have to open the folder as photos68. do not open the folder as photos. Photos68 should be the outermost directory. also, you have to make sure your launch.json is correctly configured.
All functions are implemented correctly. For move and edit, make sure you understand how it works. after you click move or copy, the next album that you edit, it will automatically move or copy the the photo to that album. make sure that you save. a lot of the times, hitting a button like add album or remove album will autosave. sometimes it will not.
